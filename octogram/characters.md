# Alan Walter

Alan Walter is a 30-ish year old businessman, high in the chain of command at Thrive. 
he doesn't do much as work, though; he is mostly seen walking around town. He is close
friends with Valentine Ludus, an exec at another company close to Thrive; they were 
business partnersbefore they were close friends.

His main element is Light, with hints of Darkness. (note: light is not the opposite of 
Darkness, Brightness is.) He is able to tranform his body into light, allowing for near 
light speed movement, but transformation isn't instant. It takes the same amount of time
to transform as it does for blood to make one complete trip around his body.
